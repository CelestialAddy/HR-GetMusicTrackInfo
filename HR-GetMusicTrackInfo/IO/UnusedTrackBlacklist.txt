### Track names in here are considered "unused" by the game, and hence so by the PY scripts.
### This unused-ness is ABSOLUTE, NOT LEVEL-SPECIFIC.
### Anything on a line after # is ignored.

### Special cases (region assigned but either literally or typically unreachable).
### Maintained as a hack/legacy feature/in case *absolutely needed*...
### ... you should probably just use the UnusedRegionBlacklist by Level instead.
